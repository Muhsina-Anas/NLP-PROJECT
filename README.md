# 💼 Fake Job Posting Detection using NLP + Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project detects whether a job posting is **Real or Fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The system analyzes job descriptions and predicts fraudulent job postings using **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model.

A Flask web application allows users to enter a job posting and receive a prediction in real time.

## ⚙️ Model Performance

After comparing multiple machine learning models, **Linear SVM** achieved the best performance.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Model | Linear SVM |
| Accuracy | **98.76%** |
| F1 Score | **0.8625** |
| Recall | **0.7976** |
| Feature Extraction | TF-IDF |

## 🧪 Example Prediction

### Input

```text
Work from home job.
Earn $5000 per week.
No experience required.
Apply immediately.
```

### Output

```text
⚠️ Fake Job Posting
```

---

## 💾 Model Saving

```python
import joblib

joblib.dump(best_svm, "model.pkl")
joblib.dump(tfidf, "tfidf.pkl")
```

---

## 🌐 Running the Flask Application

### Run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

### Open in your browser

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### Steps

1. Paste a job description.
2. Click **Predict**.
3. View whether the posting is **Real** or **Fake**.
